* <b>selfh.st/apps</b> and <b>selfh.st/companions</b> have been consolidated onto a single page. Users can easily switch between the two using the Software/Companion switch.
* Tags and source details are now hidden by default. Users can hide/unhide them in bulk using the <b>Details</b> toggle at the top of the page.
* Details for individual tiles can be expanded and collapsed by clicking a tile when the <b>Details</b> toggle is disabled
* Closed source projects can now be filtered when browsing the directory using the <b>Closed Source</b> toggle at the top of the page
* Project icons not found in the [dashboard-icons](https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons) repository are now being maintained and stored in the project's repository. The work has been started to transition all icons to independent maintenance to eventually be loaded as sprites for optimization purposes.
* Readability of project details has been improved by justifying values to the right and adding a dotted line separator between identifiers and values (inspired by the [OpenAlternative.co](https://github.com/piotrkulpinski/openalternative?ref=selfh.st) open-source project)
* Open-source companion project tiles now include license, latest version, and last activity details
* URL properties for some attributes have been updated to improve the readability of shared links
* The <b>Platform</b> filter for companion apps has been replaced with a <b>Tags</b> filter. Users should utilize search to filter by platform.
* Lazy loading has been implemented to improve page load speeds by only generating 100 tiles at a time
