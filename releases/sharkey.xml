    <content>&lt;p&gt;It's been a long while since the last release, but alas here we are with another Release after 2 Months of waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release includes a lot of bug fixes, and not many big features unlike the last release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in this Release:
- fixed lines connecting replies
- added a hover effect to replies in the detailed view
- if a direct link to a note in a long thread is opened a highlight will show which post is being linked to
- added download buttons for audio and video attachments
- added ability to select tossface emoji
- added oneko, the cute cat that follows your mouse pointer
- added a warning that will show up if you try to post images without alt text (this can be turned off)
- when searching for emoji, the closest match is shown first
- added ability to disable notifications from achievements
- the AiScript "scratchpad" shows line numbers in the editor and in error messages
- added ability for admins to set an URL for donations
- for translations, DeepLX-JS is supported in addition to regular DeepL
- blocked / silenced / suspended instances will not be listed to non-logged-in users, this makes it harder to target your instance for harassment based on who you block
- added a notification for when someone edits a post you have been tagged in
- made several improvements to the Mod player that should make it faster
- fixed the bug that would cause Sharkey to not work on older IOS devices / Safari version
- alot of fixes have been made to muting and blocking
- &lt;code&gt;signToActivityPubGet&lt;/code&gt; now defaults to true even if not set in the config
- import from twitter decodes &amp;amp;lt; etc
- reworked the boost visibility selector (only shows values that you can use, "local" is a separate switch)
- import from mastodon keeps alt text
- expandAllCws also expands all long posts on first click&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in addition all the new features and bug fixes from the latest Misskey releases til 2024.3.1 have also been added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Note for Users that have migrated from FireFish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misskey has brought back Reversi, but firefish has dropped related tables, you will have to recreate those tables, please use "BEGIN;" before running any of these, so if anything goes wrong your database doesn't end up in a broken state
&lt;code&gt;sql
-- Misskey used to have a Reversi game, Firefish dropped the tables,
-- now Misskey uses them again
CREATE TABLE "reversi_game" ("id" character varying(32) NOT NULL, "createdAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL, "startedAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, "user1Id" character varying(32) NOT NULL, "user2Id" character varying(32) NOT NULL, "user1Accepted" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, "user2Accepted" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, "black" integer, "isStarted" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, "isEnded" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, "winnerId" character varying(32), "surrendered" character varying(32), "logs" jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]', "map" character varying(64) array NOT NULL, "bw" character varying(32) NOT NULL, "isLlotheo" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, "canPutEverywhere" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, "loopedBoard" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, "form1" jsonb DEFAULT null, "form2" jsonb DEFAULT null, "crc32" character varying(32), CONSTRAINT "PK_76b30eeba71b1193ad7c5311c3f" PRIMARY KEY ("id"));
CREATE INDEX "IDX_b46ec40746efceac604142be1c" ON "reversi_game" ("createdAt");
CREATE TABLE "reversi_matching" ("id" character varying(32) NOT NULL, "createdAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL, "parentId" character varying(32) NOT NULL, "childId" character varying(32) NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT "PK_880bd0afbab232f21c8b9d146cf" PRIMARY KEY ("id"));

    <title>New release for Sharkey: 2024.3.2 Security Release</title>
    <updated>2024-03-30T11:28:05+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;h2&gt;This is a minor release with important security fixes please update immediately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in this Release:
- prohibited words are now correctly checked when creating notes
- notes with CW are no longer shown on the welcome page for non-logged-in users
- database migrations should no longer timeout
- docker image improvements
- important security fixes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Note for Users that do NOT use S3 and that USE Docker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some improvements made to the Docker images that should fix some issues with that the container now runs as a seperate Sharkey user with id 991:991 so its required to change ownership of the files directory to do that run the following in the directory where your docker-compose.yml file is
```bash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;replace web with what ever you named the sharkey service if you changed the default docker compose file&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;docker compose exec --user=root web chown -R sharkey:sharkey /sharkey/files
```&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a security fix for a defect in the validation of JSON-LD signatures that could lead to account takeover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-ascii characters are now allowed in custom emoji names (please don't go too wild, other instances may not recognise the names)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI language is now saved and restored in "preferences backup"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embedding a CW-ed note on other sites now only shows the CW, not the whole note&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various imports, and the generation of movie thumbnails, are once again working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ranged requests to proxied files are now correctly handled (should improve video playback on iOS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the modtracker player is now loaded on-demand, so the frontend loads faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;floating UI windows now render custom emojis in the titlebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the "word mute" feature now includes poll choices and image alt-texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;custom emoji should look better in admin panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;un-pinning emojis from the selector pop-up works better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;editing a note to add/remove an attachment, or the edit alt-text, works properly now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instance description and server rules can now contain more HTML (images, centered text, details/summary, styled links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clearing cached files from drive should be more reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all paginated views (e.g. timelines, various admin pages) should be more stable and not randomly drop items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;antennas can now include all users from an instance (e.g. &lt;code&gt;*@example.com&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optional notification dot on browser icon (there are CORS restrictions, check &lt;a href="https://docs.joinsharkey.org/docs/install/faqs/"&gt;our FAQ&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any configuration value can be overridden via environment variables (see &lt;a href="https://docs.joinsharkey.org/docs/install/fresh/"&gt;our installation guide&lt;/a&gt; for details)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more timelines have the "show boosts" and "only notes with files" filters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the "oneko" animation frames can be changed via &lt;a href="https://docs.joinsharkey.org/docs/customisation/themes/"&gt;theming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better rendering of notes with bidirectional and right-to-left text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parent notes can be collapsed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search results in "manage custom emoji" should now show all matching emoji&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more MFM effects: &lt;code&gt;$[followmouse]&lt;/code&gt; from Cutiekey, &lt;code&gt;$[crop]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$[fade]&lt;/code&gt; from Firefish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;users can select their preferred search engine for MFM's &lt;code&gt;[search]&lt;/code&gt; feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when editing a note, the update is now also sent to people who reacted or boosted the original note, even if they are not following the author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;admins can delete all files of a user with a single button click&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably lighter load in some clustering setups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;admins can set separate download timeout / max size for imports (e.g. note imports)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some security fixes related to malicious notes and UI interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Sharkey: 2024.8.1</title>
    <updated>2024-09-13T19:00:50+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;User visible changes:
* You can now search your drive files by name or description.
* You can now disable the "edited" notifications.
* When you block a user, they're now also muted, so you won't see their notes even if they get boosted into your timeline (you can un-mute them if you want).
* "My Plays" page now shows the visibility of plays without clicking into each individual play.
* Users can now report pages, galleries, and plays.
* Follow requests from suspended accounts are no longer shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of interest to admins:
* Password checks and websocket connections are rate limited now; this improves security and resistance to denial-of-service attacks.
* When an admin deletes all files of another user, those deletions are logged in the moderation log.
* All memory caches are now limited, Sharkey should use less RAM overall.
* new setting &lt;code&gt;attachLdSignatureForRelays&lt;/code&gt; to disable sending LD-Signatures to relays.
* More checks at startup: db reachability, config file presence.
* URL previews are cached on the server, this should reduce the load on websites that get linked in popular notes.
* Remote documents that return &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; but specify &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/activity+json" href="..."/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags are now supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some column sizes have changed; upstream recommendeds to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql
DROP INDEX "public"."IDX_e5848eac4940934e23dbc17581";
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY "IDX_e5848eac4940934e23dbc17581" ON "drive_file" ("uri");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manually on your database&lt;/p&gt;</content>
