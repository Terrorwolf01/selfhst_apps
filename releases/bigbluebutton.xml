    <content>&lt;p&gt;This 2.6 iteration includes a couple of security patches. The latest locale changes have also been included. We also updated a couple dependencies tagged as containing vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: We removed support for POST requests on &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; endpoint and also Content-Type headers are now required&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BigBlueButton 2.6.18/2.7.8 POST requests are no longer allowed for the &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. To ensure they are validated properly, a &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt; header must also be provided for POST requests that contain data in the request body. Endpoints now support a limited set of content types that includes &lt;code&gt;text/xml&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;application/xml&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;application/x-www-form-url-encoded&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt;. By default each endpoint only supports &lt;code&gt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt;, but individual endpoints can override this and define their own set of supported content types. The &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; endpoint supports all of the four previously listed content types while &lt;code&gt;insertDocument&lt;/code&gt; supports only &lt;code&gt;text/xml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;application/xml&lt;/code&gt;. Any requests with a content type that differs from the set supported by the target endpoint will be rejected with a new &lt;code&gt;unsupportedContentType&lt;/code&gt; error.  &lt;/p&gt;
