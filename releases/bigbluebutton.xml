    <title>New release for BigBlueButton: BigBlueButton 2.7.4</title>
    <updated>2024-01-15T15:52:08-05:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This iteration of BigBlueButton 2.7 contains several &lt;strong&gt;security patches&lt;/strong&gt; including in BigBlueButton itself, in FreeSWITCH and some other libraries. Additionally cursor and zoom control were improved. We recommend you upgrade as the FreeSWITCH advisory is already public. The two BigBlueButton advisories listed in the release notes will be published not earlier than the end of January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have included a first version of integration with &lt;a href="https://gladia.io"&gt;gladia.io&lt;/a&gt; for closed captions. BigBlueButton is adding support for Gladia as a closed captions provider. There is initial documentation for the integration &lt;a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/administration/customize#configuration-of-gladiaio"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Expect more updates and documentation in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank the French Ministry of Education and Dinum who have supported the development of the integration with https://www.gladia.io/, an AI driven speech-to-text service for live transcriptions. (In French) Le projet BigBlueButton souhaite remercier le ministère français de l' Education Nationale et la Dinum, qui a directement contribué au développement de cette version en finançant de nouvelles fonctionnalités.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome any feedback about this release on our &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev"&gt;bigbluebutton-dev mailing list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that BigBlueButton 2.7 runs on Ubuntu Focal (20.04).&lt;/p&gt;
