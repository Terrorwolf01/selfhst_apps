    <title>New release for LinguaCafe: v0.6</title>
    <updated>2024-01-29T16:10:46-05:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New features:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Added an always open and fixed sidebar vocabulary as a default option for screens wider than 960px. It can be turned off in the text reader settings.
- Added a minimalistic vocabulary box, that appears when the user moves the mouse over a word. It can be turned off in the text reader settings.
- Added youtube subtitle import option.
- Added hotkeys for the text reader and review pages.
- Added proper finish reading screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug fixes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Users clicking anywhere outside of the vocabulary box will close the vocabulary box. Previously it only worked if the user clicked on an empty space inside the text box.
- Increased maximum execution time for importing dictionaries. If your dictionary import did not end with a success message but still functional, I recommend importing it again, because it probably did not import all the records from the dictionary file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other changes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Updated node.js to v20.11.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new hover vocabulary slows down the media player page significantly. The interactive text part of the code will probably has to be re-worked, to make the media player faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you for everyone who contributed for the release!&lt;/h2&gt;</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New features:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Replaced the python Django server with Bottle for better performance.
- Added dynamic language model loading. Models are only going to be loaded at the first import for each language. This will significantly decrease memory use based on which and how many langauges are used on a server after its startup.
- Added new "Plain text" import option.
- Added new "Text file" import option.
- Added new "Jellyfin subtitle" import option.
- Added new "Subtitle file" import option.
- Setting words' and phrases' level is now possible while hovering over them.
- Added dictionary search for hover vocabulary box.
- Added DeepL search for hover vocabulary box.
- Separated DeepL search from regular dictionary search in the vocabulary box. Users won't have to wait for DeepL server's response to see the dictionary search results which load much faster.
- Added loading indicator for vocabulary box dictionary search.
- Added an option to automatically highlight a word when it gets a translation added to it.
- A list of words which were not counted in the statistics now will be automatically set to ignored when imported. Also added all numbers and more symbols to the list.
- Vocabulary search page's edit dialog now will close on its own after saving it, and the search results will be updated automatically.
- Added chapter length option to import dialog.
- Added hotkeys for text scrolling.
- The selected library layout will now be remembered.
- Added option to change the default MySQL database and user.
- Added windows installation guide and installation file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug fixes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Fixed a bug that caused the records on the vocabulary search page to appear in random order inside the specified order by parameter.
- Fixed an issue in the text reader glossary, where empty parentheses were visible in languages that have no readings.
- Fixed a visual issue where the scrollbars' background were a different color than the area they were placed on.
- Fixed an issue that caused long chapter titles to hide the text.
- Furigana now displays the editable reading field. Previously it displayed the reading that was assigned to the exact word in text while importing it.
- Fixed a visual issue where the day text was not visible in the calendar while using dark theme.
- Added missing lemma to review card when using example sentence mode.
- Removed furigana from e-book imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other changes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Removed media player page, it has been replaced with Jellyfin subtitle import option.
- Improved text selecting design.
- Removed unnecessary files from the webserver image and decreased its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you for everyone who contributed for the release!&lt;/h2&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for LinguaCafe: v0.8</title>
    <updated>2024-03-20T23:39:42-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;h1&gt;Please create a backup before updating to prevent any possible data loss. A lot of server code has been refactored, and there always can be unexpected problems. There is a page on backups in the user manual.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new user manual can be viewed on the GitHub &lt;a href="https://simjanos-dev.github.io/LinguaCafeHome/#user-manual"&gt;overview page&lt;/a&gt; as well. It is lacking many pages currently, but it will be expanded regularly. English is not my native language, and I think my phrasing is not great, so please feel free to improve and modify it. I recognized that many things in LinguaCafe are not explained anywhere, and I'll try to work on those pages first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New features:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Added "website" import option.
- Added vocabulary word import from .csv.
- Added start review dialog for the review button in the navigation sidebar.
- Added review finished information cards, instead of redirecting the user to the homepage.
- Word counts now load automatically when you open a book.
- Added a setting for hover vocabulary's delay.
- Added user manual. Will be extended and updated regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug fixes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Review cards' content overflowed the buttons.
- Books with long titles hid their open button.
- Daily read words goal was not updating while reviewing phrases if the sentence mode was not selected.
- Vocabulary sidebar had a minor visual problem with its edges.
- Text reader had an error if the opened chapter had no text.
- Renamed label "stage" to "level" on vocabulary page to make it consistent.
- Non Chinese and Japanese phrases were only searchable on the vocabulary page without spaces. This fix only applies to phrases created after this update.
- Non Chinese and Japanese phrases were displayed incorrectly on the vocabulary sidebar.
- Phrases were displayed incorrectly on the vocabulary export dialog.
- Reading fields were visible on vocabulary search page's edit dialog for languages that had no readings.
- Numpad hotkeys were not working.
- Hover vocabulary's search dictionary setting was not working when it was turned off.
- Hover vocabulary sent a request to the server even if you took the mouse off from the hovered word before the delay ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other changes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- If DeepL is disabled for a language, the dictionaries will not show a DeepL error message anymore, and they also won't make a request to retrieve the DeepL translations.
- For better performance and to avoid accidentaly opening hover vocabulary on words, a slight delay was added before the hover vocabulary box becomes visible. The dictionary and DeepL searches already had this delay, it just has been applied to the visibility of the hover vocabulary box as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you for everyone who contributed for the release!&lt;/h2&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;backup&lt;/strong&gt; LinguaCafe before updating, otherwise you can lose your data if anything goes wrong. You can read more about backups in the &lt;a href="https://simjanos-dev.github.io/LinguaCafeHome/#user-manual"&gt;user manual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mac changes&lt;/h4&gt;
