&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future versions of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small patch release that fixes a few regressions introduced in the last released related to labels. It also includes some minor security patches, and introduces a new script to &lt;a href="https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/convert-unencrypted-custom-fields"&gt;convert a previously unencrypted custom field to be an encrypted custom field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v7 is still well on its way. We hit a small snag with Laravel's switch from Swiftmailer to Symfony for mail sending, but we're back on track now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed Labels: bulk actions are handled before sorting by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14375&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added route parameter by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14372&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade &lt;code&gt;jspdf-autotable&lt;/code&gt; from 3.8.1 to 3.8.2 #14365 by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14378&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed 1dbarcodes to populate based on settings by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14380&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added User email check when sending Asset acceptance reminder by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14371&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes CVE-2024-27354 and CVE-2024-27355 in phpseclib/phpseclib by @joelpittet in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14370&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default label setup with custom fields by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14320&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix #13515: Cannot restore backup by @chandanchowdhury in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14379&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added console command to encrypt previously unencrypted fields by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14385&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed attempting to run bulk actions on an empty asset collection by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14388&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed old label engine to work as intended with CSS by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14389&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed unneeded validation message by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14392&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guard against checking require acceptance on non-existent relationship in accessory model by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14393&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Snyk] Upgrade webpack from 5.90.1 to 5.90.2 by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14395&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure Chat and Teams endpoints are not blank before attempting to send webhook on checkout and check in by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14394&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@chandanchowdhury made their first contribution in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14379&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v6.3.4</title>
    <updated>2024-03-29T09:40:53-04:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The upcoming v7 release of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday! Lots of fixes and improvements in this version. Here's the tldr;, with the full changelog below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Somali translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed several label setting glitches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed some API scoping issues where results were not as constrained as they should have been when searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added column selectors and signatures to the "print all assigned" page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 2FA reset logging (this shows up as a separate action, not a normal user edit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added AVIF as an accepted image format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ability to "toggle all" columns in the list views on most pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the ability to "deep link" to search results in those list views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the documentation to reflect that the &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/exif.setup.php"&gt;php exif&lt;/a&gt; library is required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming Breaking API change!&lt;/strong&gt; In between the last release and this one, we also discovered that a change we made midway through releases broke the &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/jamf2snipe"&gt;Jamf2Snipe&lt;/a&gt; integration for adding/updating assets. We had changed the "shape" of the asset response to be more consistent with how we present that JSON in other API responses - however in doing so, we broke some of the Jamf2Snipe capabilities. We've reverted that change for now, but in the next release, we'll be adding that change back &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; updating the Jamf2Snipe library to match that capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; noticing in some of the translations in CrowdIn that some &lt;code&gt;trans_choice()&lt;/code&gt; translations are showing with a weird &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;unk&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; symbol instead of the pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) symbol that the translations strings need in order to decide whether or not to pluralize a string. We've been fixing them as we find them, but if you see anything unusual, open an issue here or &lt;a href="https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it"&gt;propose the change in our CrowdIn project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated language strings, added Somali by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14400&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The NEXT major release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, friends! This is the final release of the v6 line of Snipe-IT. (I know, I know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're hosted with us, you'll have these changes in your hot little hands within a day or so. If you're not, please make sure to upgrade your version of Snipe-IT. But more importantly, please make sure you're running PHP 8.1.x+ before you try to upgrade again after this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No breaking changes, just some small tweaks, a few added features, and a few bug fixes. We did have to address a potential (though very hard to exploit) permissions escalation issue, which is why we're making this 6.4.0 instead of a point release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v7 has been a long time coming, but we're nearly there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks as always to our community contributors for their awesome work! &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The NEXT major release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi folks - happy Monday! This is just tiny release to handle a few small remaining bug fixes as we head into v7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/tree/snipeit_v7_laravel10"&gt;current working v7 branch&lt;/a&gt; will be merged into the existing develop branch within the week, and will then be available on the https://develop.snipeitapp.com demo link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update fixes a small issue with notifications and also optimizes some of the queries that populate the sidebar that could have slowed things down for folks with a lot of assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load settings in &lt;code&gt;SendUpcomingAuditReport&lt;/code&gt; command by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14690&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes #14692 - set default variables for sidebar totals by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14693&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes #14701 - wrong total asset count by @Toreg87 in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14702&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed UI where delete button was not disabled even if the user couldn't be deleted by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14697&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix memory-hog query in AssetCountForSidebar middleware by @jerm in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14711&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bump codacy/codacy-analysis-cli-action from 4.4.0 to 4.4.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14715&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Changelog&lt;/strong&gt;: https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/compare/v6.4.0...v6.4.1&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The NEXT MAJOR release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrap it all up for v7 (which you can preview on the &lt;code&gt;snipeit_v7_laravel10&lt;/code&gt; branch, we knew there would be a few more things we needed to handle. Most of these are small bugfixes (that have already been merged into the v7 branch) but we also came across some security issues that we wanted to patch as we close off the v6 line. Users are encouraged to upgrade to v6.4.2 - and of course, encouraged to make sure your servers are ready for v7 with PHP8.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
