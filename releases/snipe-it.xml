&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, nerds! This release fixes some missing translations, adds some improvements for merging users, fixes a bug where custom field data could be lost when auditing under certain conditions, and also adds some query optimizations for speed.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1.2 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another small patch release which largely handles missing translations and the some refinements on the &lt;code&gt;upgrade.php&lt;/code&gt; script to make upgrading a little smoother, and added a boatload more automated tests. We also tightened up some queries on the consumables side, so hopefully those with much larger data sets for consumables will notice speedier load times there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we identified and fixed an issue where in some circumstances, custom field data could be lost when auditing an asset, and we also added better history tracking for consumables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General cleanup - Docblock fixes, adding type hinting, added tests, added asset model form validator by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15029&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed API key missing translations by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15055&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed missing print user assigned filter by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15059&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes Potential Exception by @spencerrlongg in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15057&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;upgrade.php&lt;/code&gt;: More helpful output when we can't read &lt;code&gt;.upgrade_requirements.json&lt;/code&gt; by @jerm in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15051&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;upgrade.php&lt;/code&gt;: If we're on windows, make sure we can load intermediate certificates by @jerm in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15052&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small consumables optimizations by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15071&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed inconsistent attributes order in Print All Assigned report by @FlorentDotMe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15069&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1.2 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is just a point release, we're really excited for this one. We've a bunch of small bug fixes, but also added some UX sugar that we think will make everyone's workflows a little bit easier. You can now decide where you want to go after creating, editing, or checking in/out a first class object (Assets, Accessories, Licenses, Users, etc). You can also now check out more than one accessory at a time, if that's a thing that comes up in your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: If your table listings text ("Showing x of y pages") defaulted to Chinese, this release handles that (via https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15133).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been doing a ton of under the hood stuff that won't seem very obvious as users, but it puts us in a much better position to move more quickly on a lot of things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important technical note: this release mitigates a difficult to exploit but possible attack. If someone had access to your &lt;code&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, it was possible to perform an RCE attack. We mitigated this by disabling cookie serialization, but I'd still argue that if someone has your &lt;code&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, you're going to have a bad time in a bunch of other ways, so this is just a gentle reminder than your APP_KEY should never, ever be shared with anyone, for any reason, and you should never use the default &lt;code&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/code&gt; values we have in some of our example env files. If you have encrypted custom fields and need to roll your &lt;code&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/code&gt; because you feel it could have been compromised, &lt;a href="https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/key-rotation"&gt;we have a cli utility to handle that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up: Custom fields for users, and the ability to check out accessories to assets and locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds a command to resend acceptance emails by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14722&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.0.11</title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1.2 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Thursday everyone! This release comes with a bunch of small UX/UI improvements, and a few additional features, including the ability to optionally update the asset's status on quick scan checkin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added the ability to play sounds on the "quick" bulk tasks like auditing for better accessibility. (You will have to enable this in your profile.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added a command-line utility that can help some folks who may have used the API to checkout assets without specifying an &lt;code&gt;assigned_type&lt;/code&gt;, and could get a 500 error when trying to view those assets. (We have since improved the API validation to require the &lt;code&gt;assigned_type&lt;/code&gt;, but older assets created via API could have had this issue.) &lt;a href="https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/fix-missing-assigned-type"&gt;See the docs on that utility here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15185"&gt;ability to checkout accessories to assets and locations&lt;/a&gt;. The functionality has been built, but there are some safeguards we still have to put in to make sure you cannot delete locations or assets that still have accessories associated with them. We &lt;a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15235"&gt;have a PR up for that&lt;/a&gt; and are working on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
