    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v6.2.3</title>

    <content>&lt;h2&gt;⚠️ IMPORTANT: Future versions of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release is largely a bug fix release. There were some rare conditions where asset history wouldn't show because the original item (location, etc) were both soft-deleted and then purged, which was causing a 500 error. This didn't affect most users, but for the ones it did affect, this was an important fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also fixes a migration issue between older versions of Snipe-IT upgrading to newer versions where it would have issues with the &lt;code&gt;eol_explicit&lt;/code&gt; field, since the asset observer tries to modify that field, but it didn't necessarily exist yet depending on where you were at with migrations. This issue is now resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added tighter controls for matching log ID and item_id by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/13726&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set resend acceptance to POST by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/13727&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes qty remaining requirements for component checkout via API by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/13728&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed the storing of group permissions when creating via API by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/13734&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed notification logic to ensure check in and out emails are delivered by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/13733&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolves issue with migrations with table prefixes by @spencerrlongg in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/13745&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #13723 - race condition on asset observer for older migration by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/13748&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle case where value is deleted in history by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/13749&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Changelog&lt;/strong&gt;: https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/compare/v6.2.2...v6.2.3&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;h2&gt;⚠️ IMPORTANT: Future versions of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year, everyone! This update is a big one as we ramp up for the release of v7. We've got tons of bug-fixes, big and small, and we're stoked to announce &lt;strong&gt;support for Microsoft Teams&lt;/strong&gt; in the notification integrations. As we continue work on v7, expect even more improvements and flexibility in notifications down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added the ability to specify custom fields that you would like to appear on the requestable assets page, and added user edit logging to track changes to users in the system (minus passwords, 2fa tokens, etc, of course), along with some bulk editing, LDAP and SAML improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future versions of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small patch release that fixes a few regressions introduced in the last released related to labels. It also includes some minor security patches, and introduces a new script to &lt;a href="https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/convert-unencrypted-custom-fields"&gt;convert a previously unencrypted custom field to be an encrypted custom field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v7 is still well on its way. We hit a small snag with Laravel's switch from Swiftmailer to Symfony for mail sending, but we're back on track now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
