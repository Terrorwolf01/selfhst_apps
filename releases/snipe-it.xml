&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future versions of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small patch release that fixes a few regressions introduced in the last released related to labels. It also includes some minor security patches, and introduces a new script to &lt;a href="https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/convert-unencrypted-custom-fields"&gt;convert a previously unencrypted custom field to be an encrypted custom field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v7 is still well on its way. We hit a small snag with Laravel's switch from Swiftmailer to Symfony for mail sending, but we're back on track now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed Labels: bulk actions are handled before sorting by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14375&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added route parameter by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14372&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fixed 1dbarcodes to populate based on settings by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14380&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added User email check when sending Asset acceptance reminder by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14371&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes CVE-2024-27354 and CVE-2024-27355 in phpseclib/phpseclib by @joelpittet in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14370&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default label setup with custom fields by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14320&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix #13515: Cannot restore backup by @chandanchowdhury in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14379&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added console command to encrypt previously unencrypted fields by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14385&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed attempting to run bulk actions on an empty asset collection by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14388&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed old label engine to work as intended with CSS by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14389&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed unneeded validation message by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14392&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guard against checking require acceptance on non-existent relationship in accessory model by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14393&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Snyk] Upgrade webpack from 5.90.1 to 5.90.2 by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14395&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure Chat and Teams endpoints are not blank before attempting to send webhook on checkout and check in by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14394&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@chandanchowdhury made their first contribution in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14379&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v6.3.4</title>
    <updated>2024-03-29T09:40:53-04:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>snipe/snipe-it</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The upcoming v7 release of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday! Lots of fixes and improvements in this version. Here's the tldr;, with the full changelog below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Somali translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed several label setting glitches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed some API scoping issues where results were not as constrained as they should have been when searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added column selectors and signatures to the "print all assigned" page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 2FA reset logging (this shows up as a separate action, not a normal user edit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added AVIF as an accepted image format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ability to "toggle all" columns in the list views on most pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the ability to "deep link" to search results in those list views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the documentation to reflect that the &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/exif.setup.php"&gt;php exif&lt;/a&gt; library is required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming Breaking API change!&lt;/strong&gt; In between the last release and this one, we also discovered that a change we made midway through releases broke the &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/jamf2snipe"&gt;Jamf2Snipe&lt;/a&gt; integration for adding/updating assets. We had changed the "shape" of the asset response to be more consistent with how we present that JSON in other API responses - however in doing so, we broke some of the Jamf2Snipe capabilities. We've reverted that change for now, but in the next release, we'll be adding that change back &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; updating the Jamf2Snipe library to match that capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; noticing in some of the translations in CrowdIn that some &lt;code&gt;trans_choice()&lt;/code&gt; translations are showing with a weird &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;unk&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; symbol instead of the pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) symbol that the translations strings need in order to decide whether or not to pluralize a string. We've been fixing them as we find them, but if you see anything unusual, open an issue here or &lt;a href="https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it"&gt;propose the change in our CrowdIn project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated language strings, added Somali by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14400&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed uninitialized string offset error in labels in new label engine when field label was blank by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14404&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed &lt;code&gt;checkout_date&lt;/code&gt; for licenses on print all assigned for users by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14407&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed deprecation warning on &lt;code&gt;strtoupper()&lt;/code&gt; by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14413&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed requestable search API scoping by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14430&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes the unused &lt;code&gt;mediconesystems/livewire-datatables&lt;/code&gt; package by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14427&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v6.4.0</title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The NEXT release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, friends! This is the final release of the v6 line of Snipe-IT. (I know, I know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're hosted with us, you'll have these changes in your hot little hands within a day or so. If you're not, please make sure to upgrade your version of Snipe-IT. But more importantly, please make sure you're running PHP 8.1.x+ before you try to upgrade again after this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No breaking changes, just some small tweaks, a few added features, and a few bug fixes. We did have to address a potential (though very hard to exploit) permissions escalation issue, which is why we're making this 6.4.0 instead of a point release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v7 has been a long time coming, but we're nearly there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks as always to our community contributors for their awesome work! &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
