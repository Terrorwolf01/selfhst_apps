    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.80.0</title>
    <updated>2024-09-24T09:48:05-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release is all about bugs! Along with v0.79.0, it includes fixes for every high-priority bug we wanted to fix for v1.0.0. A lot of these have been around for a long time, so it's great to get them closed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that though, there are a few new features too. First of all, we have a Spanish translation thanks to some fantastic work by @juanjomurga! Also, you can now use Markdown in model descriptions (used to be notes), and they're displayed under the image carousel in your models, just like you'd expect on any other model hosting site. Manyfold will also raise problems for missing metadata, like links, creators, tags, or license. To enable those, change them from "ignored" to "info" in settings. We knew there would be a lot, so we left them hidden by default üòÑ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ú® New Features ‚ú®&lt;/h3&gt;

    <content>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of work in this release, but perhaps not much is too visible. We're working on ActivityPub interoperability with platforms like Mastodon, and there's a lot of work under the hood to get us there. The visible ActivityPub interaction stuff is very near though, hopefully you'll get to see it within a week in v0.82.0!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release does have a few bug fixes though, and a new feature whereby you can split a model's files into two parts through the bulk file editor. So, if you merged things by accident, now you can undo it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
