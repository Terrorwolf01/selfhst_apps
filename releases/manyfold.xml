    <content>&lt;p&gt;A small release this week, while we do some more big changes behind the scenes for a future release. Main thing is an improvement to the automatic grouping of files in models, so that they get arranged in a more sensible way. There's more to improve here, but this should make things a bit more useful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ú® New Features ‚ú®&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve automatic part grouping in models by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/2211&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üõ†Ô∏è Other Improvements üõ†Ô∏è&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add  target="_blank" to footer links by @chryton in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/2200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding app version as an attribute by @matthewbadeau in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/2194&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@chryton made their first contribution in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/2200&lt;/li&gt;

    <content>&lt;p&gt;We had a security audit recently, thanks to NLNet / NGI Zero and Radically Open Security. This release fixes a load of security issues that were found in the audit, many of which fix other bugs at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest obvious change is that you should now set &lt;code&gt;PUID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PGID&lt;/code&gt; environment variables to specify which user and group Manyfold should run as - before, it would run as root because that's what Docker does by default, and that's obviously a security risk. If you don't set those variables, it will continue to run as root, but it will warn you loudly until you change it! Don't forget to make sure that your libraries are writable by the user you choose!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit our new &lt;a href="https://manyfold.app/sysadmin/security"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; page for more details on these and other new options to make your instances more secure!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.70.0</title>
    <updated>2024-06-29T06:07:19-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This releases brings BIG changes to the upload process. Firstly, file upload progress is shown as it happens, so you can see what's going on; then, the extraction of zip files happens in the background, so you can carry on using Manyfold while it happens. Models are created straight away, without the need for a full scan, so the "scan after upload" button has gone away. And finally, perhaps our single most popular feature request - you can now upload individual files as new models! So, no need to zip up a single STL any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're certainly going to build on this more, with options like uploading files into an existing model, and renaming models during the upload process, which you can see on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/manyfold3d/projects/4"&gt;feature roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also made changes to the way the background processing works. Expensive jobs like geometric analysis and file conversion may now take a little longer to work through by default, but they shouldn't saturate the server and stop other things happening in the meantime. You can control the concurrency of the background runners using the new &lt;code&gt;DEFAULT_WORKER_CONCURRENCY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PERFORMANCE_WORKER_CONCURRENCY&lt;/code&gt; options, which are set to 4 and 1 by default. If you have lots of CPU and memory on your server, you can bump those up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying change that's enabled all of this is a big rewrite of the actual file storage engine. You shouldn't notice any difference, although this enables some great stuff in future, like support for cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: it may take a long time to migrate data during the upgrade, depending on the size of your library, perhaps in the region of 10-20 seconds per gigabyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any problems, as always, come say hi in our very helpful &lt;a href="https://matrix.to/#/#manyfold:one.ems.host"&gt;support chat&lt;/a&gt; or file a &lt;a href="https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/issues/new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=bug&amp;amp;projects=&amp;amp;template=bug_report.md&amp;amp;title="&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
